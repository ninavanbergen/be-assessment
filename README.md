# Lifestyle Lovers
My application is a dating application where users can find a partner that can fit in their lifestyle. 

If you want to install my application, you have to do the following:
1. First you have to git clone my link: 
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/ninavanbergen/be-assessment-2.git
```
2. Then you need to go to that file, by doing so:
(if you renamed the file then you need to change the name after cd /)
```javascript
cd /be-assessment-2.git 
```
3. When you're in the file, you need to install some things, let's start with npm:
(you will see a download bar, it may take a while)
```javascript
npm install
```
4. Let's begin with installing express! But what is express? [Here](https://github.com/expressjs/express)  is a link to an explanation of express.
