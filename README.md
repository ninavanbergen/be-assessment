My application is a dating application where users can find a partner that can fit in their lifestyle. 

If you want to install my application, you have to do the following:
First you have to git clone my link: 
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/ninavanbergen/be-assessment-2.git
```
Then you need to go to that file, by doing so:
(if you renamed the file then you need to change the name after cd /)
```javascript
cd /be-assessment-2.git 
```
When you're in the file, you need to install some things, let's start with npm:
(you will see a download bar, it may take a while)
```javascript
npm install
```
